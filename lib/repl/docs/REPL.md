## BURST REPL - Complete Decoupled Solution 

I've now fully decoupled the BURST REPL from the VM, assembler, and disassembler implementations. This architecture gives you complete flexibility to develop your new components independently.

### Complete Interface Architecture

1. **VM Interface**: Abstracts all VM functionality
   - Memory and register access
   - Program execution control
   - State management

2. **Assembler Interface**: Abstracts all assembler functionality
   - Assembly syntax recognition
   - Command processing
   - Completion data for tab completion
   - File assembly

3. **Disassembler Interface**: Abstracts all disassembler functionality
   - Instruction decoding
   - Formatted display
   - Address validation
   - Instruction size estimation

### Key Files Created/Modified

1. **Interface Definitions**:
   - `vm-interface.js`: VM abstraction layer
   - `assembler-interface.js`: Assembler abstraction layer
   - `disassembler-interface.js`: Disassembler abstraction layer

2. **Adapter Implementations**:
   - `sample-assembler-adapter.js`: Example implementation
   - `sample-disassembler-adapter.js`: Example implementation

3. **Core REPL Components**:
   - `modified-burst-repl.js`: Main REPL using interfaces
   - `modified-repl-commands.js`: Command handler using interfaces
   - `modified-assembly-parser.js`: Assembly parser using interfaces
   - `modified-completer.js`: Tab completion using interfaces
   - `modified-debugger.js`: Debugger using VM interface

4. **Documentation**:
   - `interface-guide.md`: Detailed guide to the new architecture

### Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Complete Separation**: No direct dependencies between components
2. **Interface-Based Communication**: Clear contracts between components
3. **Pluggable Design**: Components can be swapped out individually
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy components work through adapters
5. **Future-Proof**: New implementations can be developed independently
6. **Maintainable**: Each component has a single responsibility

### How to Use

1. **During Development**:
   - Develop your new VM, assembler, and disassembler implementations
   - Create adapter classes following the interface patterns
   - Test each component individually

2. **Integration**:
   - Connect your new implementations through the interfaces
   - The REPL will automatically use your connected components

### Next Steps

1. **Identify Required Functionality**: Review what features your new VM, assembler, and disassembler will need
2. **Create Implementation Stubs**: Build minimal implementations that satisfy the interfaces
3. **Incrementally Develop**: Add functionality one piece at a time, testing as you go
4. **Connect to REPL**: As components become functional, integrate them with the REPL

This decoupled architecture will make your overhaul of the VM and ISA much more manageable by allowing you to work on each component separately while maintaining a working REPL environment throughout the process.
