# BURST Project Goals

## Vision

BURST (Basic Universal Reference System Toolkit) aims to create a foundational computing platform that bridges the gap between modern high-level programming and low-level system understanding. It's designed to be both powerful enough for real applications and simple enough for educational purposes.

## Primary Goals

### 1. Educational Foundation
- Provide a clear, understandable model of computation
- Enable hands-on learning about computer architecture
- Support progressive disclosure of complexity
- Include comprehensive documentation and examples

### 2. Universal Platform
- Run on any modern computing device (native, web, mobile)
- Provide consistent behavior across all platforms
- Support both interpreted and JIT-compiled execution
- Enable cross-platform application development

### 3. Minimal Design
- Small, orthogonal instruction set
- Clear separation of concerns
- No unnecessary complexity
- Easy to implement on new platforms

### 4. Extensible Architecture
- Support for multiple programming languages
- LLVM backend compatibility
- Pluggable system services
- Community-driven enhancement model

### 5. Interactive Environment
- Built-in shell and REPL
- Immediate feedback for learners
- Visual debugging capabilities
- System introspection tools

### 6. Real-World Capability
- Sufficient performance for practical applications
- Access to host system resources
- Network and filesystem support
- Security and sandboxing features

## Design Principles

### Simplicity First
Every feature must justify its complexity. When in doubt, choose the simpler solution.

### Learn by Doing
The system should encourage experimentation and provide immediate, understandable feedback.

### No Magic
All system behavior should be observable and explainable. No hidden complexity.

### Gradual Complexity
Users should be able to start simple and gradually explore more advanced features.

### AI-Human Collaboration
Embrace the AI-assisted nature of the project as a feature, not something to hide.

## Success Criteria

1. A student can understand the entire system architecture in one semester
2. The core VM can be implemented in under 1000 lines of code
3. Programs run with acceptable performance on web browsers
4. The system can host its own development environment
5. Community adopts and extends the platform

## Non-Goals

- Competing with production VMs (JVM, CLR) on performance
- Supporting every possible CPU architecture natively
- Backwards compatibility with existing bytecode formats
- Enterprise-scale deployment features

## Inspiration and Differentiation

BURST learns from but differs from existing systems:

- **Simpler than JVM**: No complex class loading or verification
- **More portable than WASM**: Includes high-level system abstractions
- **More educational than production VMs**: Designed for understanding
- **More practical than toy VMs**: Can run real applications

## Long-term Vision

BURST could become:
- A standard platform for computer science education
- A research vehicle for VM and language design
- A foundation for experimental operating systems
- A bridge between high-level languages and system programming
