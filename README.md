# BURST - Basic Universal Reference System Toolkit

BURST is a minimal bytecode runtime and virtual machine designed to be a universal computing foundation. Created with AI assistance, it aims to provide an educational, cross-platform environment for learning about computer architecture and operating systems.

## Core Goals

1. **Minimal bytecode runtime** - A clean, efficient instruction set that's easy to understand and implement
2. **Platform agnostic** - Target native systems, web browsers, Electron, and more
3. **Educational focus** - Designed for people learning about computers and system programming
4. **Language ecosystem** - Support for LLVM and native language development
5. **Interactive environment** - Built-in terminal and REPL for exploration
6. **Host OS integration** - Bridge to native filesystem and system resources
7. **Self-contained** - Built-in filesystem and core utilities

## Project Structure

- `burst-vm.js` - Core virtual machine implementation
- `docs/` - Documentation and specifications
  - `GOALS.md` - Detailed project goals and vision
  - `DESIGN.md` - Design principles and architecture
  - `ISA.md` - Instruction Set Architecture specification
  - `SYSCALLS.md` - System call interface documentation

## Quick Start

```javascript
const { BurstVM, BurstAssembler } = require('./burst-vm.js');

// Create a new VM instance
const vm = new BurstVM();

// Load and run a program
const program = createProgram();
vm.loadProgram(program);
vm.run();
```
